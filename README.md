# dotfiles

### QA

**Q**: **What are dotfiles?**  
**A**: Well, they're system configuration files. This repository is just convenience to have them stored somewhere safe.

**Q**: **Can I use your code?**  
**A**: They're heavily fine-tuned for me and my setup, but I won't stop you from using it. Mind you that you will have to rename the file paths, unless, of course, your name is also Aura.

**Q**: **Did you draw inspiration from somebody else's dotfiles?**  
**A**: Yes, I did, my friend @favna has a very solid setup [here](https://github.com/favna/dotfiles). My dotfiles are smaller because I like to keep things simple. Still, this repository's structure is heavily based on his.

**Q**: **What OS are the dotfiles for?**  
**A**: They're made specifically for Windows 11 with Microsoft PowerShell v7. Older versions of Windows may work, and I do not suggest using __Windows__ PowerShell (v5 or older) at all. For Linux/MacOS, you can adapt the paths a little, and it should in theory work.

**Q**: **Why is there no Linux support?**  
**A**: Because I don't use a Linux machine to start with, besides my VPS.

**Q**: **What terminal do you recommend for Windows?**  
**A**: Windows Terminal is what I use.

**Q**: **I use Arch btw**  
**A**: That's not a question. But you can find zsh configs online.

**Q**: **What font do you use?**  
**A**: I use `CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font` from [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

**Q**: **Will you continue updating this repository?**  
**A**: Yes, I will. Make sure to watch this repository if you want to keep up with the updates. :eyes:

**Q**: **Why are this repository's commits formatted with conventional commits?**  
**A**: Because I can.
